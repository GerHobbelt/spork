A @strong[generator] is an iterable data structure which yields individual values whenever called, potentially until its internal values are exhausted, at which point it's considered @em[dead].

This operation makes them very useful for:

@ul{@li{Asynchronous behaviour}
    @li{Memory-sensitive applications, where it's not necessary to keep an entire sequence in memory at once}
    @li{Infinite sequences}}

NB: Certain functions (specifically @code`run` and @code`to-array`) will create an infinite loop if their argument is an infinite generator!
